    <i>&#34;I think we judge talent wrong&#46; What do we see as talent? I think I have made the same mistake myself&#46; <br>
        We judge talent by people's ability to strike a cricket ball&#46; <br>
        The sweetness, the timing. That's the only thing we see as talent.Things like determination, courage, discipline, temperament, these are also talent.&#34;

    <h3>Cricket:</h3>
    <p>
        Cricket is a sport which is played between two teams of eleven players each.<br>
        One team, which is batting, tries to score runs , while the other team is fielding,<br>
        and tries to prevent this.Runs are scored by hitting the ball,<br>
        which is thrown by a player from the fielding team to a player from the batting team, across the boundary,<br>
